# WineDirect Accessible Slick Slider

This is a fork of [slick.js](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) that has been customized to resolve most accessibility issues and work with the Photo Gallery tools on WineDirect front end websites. Credit to https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/pull/3716 for a lot of the initial accessibility work.
